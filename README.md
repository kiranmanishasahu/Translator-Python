# Translator-Python
Imaagine a situation where we need to change a text file of nearly 1000-2000 lines to another language.
I am preety sure its going to take more than 2 hours to change one by one every line to the desired language through google translator.
Here I use the API of Google Translator and pass the whole text file that i want to change.
then i give the destination language to which I want the whole file to convert to.
Now just run the program.Your 2hrs works is done in 2secs.
